# Book Library API (book-lib-api)
Golang book library API

Online library. REST API which allows clients to consume the list of available books, as well as to read those books page by page in the desired formats.

Books will be available (page by page) in plain text and HTML. In future iterations, we would like to add support for more reading formats, as well as support to interface with other online book service providers.  

## Rules
- Do not use any frameworks. A good developer must know how to select his tools and how to use them.
- The use of third-party libraries is allowed and encouraged.
